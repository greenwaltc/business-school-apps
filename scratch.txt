Request:
    fr-CA

first try an exact match on both language and country code
if no match exists, then try matching on only language
    but the campaign message shouldn't have a country code in this case

Scenario 1: // exact match
    request fr-CA
    campaign message translations available: en-US, es-MX, fr-CA
    return fr-CA

Scenario 2: // match exists but only for language code
    request fr-CA
    campaign message translations available: en-US, es-MX, fr
    return fr
    // mapping from fr-CA -> fr IS ACCEPTABLE if and only if fr-CA is not available AND fr is available

Scenario 3: // no match exists, don't assume anything about country code
    request fr-CA
    campaign message translations available: en-US, es-MX, fr-GB
    return 404
    // don't map from fr-CA -> fr-GB

Scenario 4: // don't provide country code
    request fr
    return 400, country code required
