Talents that I may want to weave in:
•	Quickly assess a situation, but have a willingness to listen to mentors and listen to sound advice. Some news feed post isn’t going to influence me, I’m going to make my own decisions.
•	Not a crowd lemming. Not a knowledge lemming
•	Very curious. Like to learn new things. How does this thing fit with that thing
•	Give me the boundaries and move them to a new planet and deal with them there
•	Background gives me compassion and space for people to be different and allow them. You can get something from a lot of different people. (one of the benefits of coming from struggle). Extra dose of compassion for others that need something.
Just blows my mind the things offered here are not offered other places
Culture of connection for people who will help me after school
Add human to the essays – thinking bigger and grander, realizing I need a posse to do it. I want to be with people who are bigger and smarter and better than me so I can learn from them and they can learn from me.
