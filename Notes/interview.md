found out really cool healthcare applications for computer science in my master's degree (sci vis)
always knew I eventually wanted to start a business, and I figured getting deep technical expertise would really help in that goal


Tell me about yourself (walk me through your resume)

    - Pre college I served a proselytizing mission in north carolina where I got to lead teams of other missionaries
    - Majored in Computer Science at BYU. One cool thing I did here was participate as a research assistant in a lab where I got to lead development of robotics, computer vision, AI, etc to get a robot to interact with a human opponent in a game
    - Went to work for a government contract company that did work for the united states intelligence community because I thought going into a really niche, highly technical area would really help me in my long-term career success. However, I quickly realized that top secret government work was not for me. I didn't like the culture of isolation, beauracracy, and limited growth opportunity. I learned to not value hygiene factors over everything else
    - While at Rincon, I started a master's degree in computer science because I knew that having deep technical knowledge would really help me when I start a company in the future.
    - During my master's I had one class where I learned a lot of really cool applications for computer science in healthcare domain (sci viz, deep learning) -- ties into career vision
    - I sought more growth opportunity, so I left Rincon despite only being there a short time and joined Dexcom, where I got to grow my software engineering skills a ton and develop interpersonal skills.
    - At dexcom, I got to lead my development team for 4 months (basically the tech lead role) and interact with many different stakeholders of the project
    - The project I worked on I took from start to finish, whereas most other software engineers will only get to work on a limited scope of the software product lifecycle.

"Great! So...why are you looking to do an MBA at this time?"

    - long term vision: start a venture that delivers a medical technology to alleviate suffering of neurological conditions
    - motivation for this is my experience with my dad
    - I'm not ready for that yet: I don't have the toolkit, network, or experience to start that right now, otherwise I would.
    - the role that would most directly prepare me for that long-term goal is that of product manager in medtech, where I can innovate existing products and launch new products.
    - I can become a product manager at a good company faster through the MBA route than I could on my own. And I don't want to become a product manager at my current company.
    - Plus, if I become a product manager through the MBA route, then I will get a whole lot of positive externalities (most importantly the network) that will help me throughout my career, especially when I want to start a business.

"What is your 'Plan B' if..."

    - Plan B is to go into project management, because I'll get good experience creating teams, keeping teams on development timelines, allocating resources, coordinating with relevant parties... but I'll miss out on getting to create product vision and being a true innovator, which is why the product manager route would be better.

"Which other schools are you applying to?"

    - Booth because of locale but they don't have as mature of healthcare-related offerings, and they got rid of their partner's club, which is important to me because of wife and kid
    - duke because of NC and healthcare in the research triangle, but they don't have as many entrepreneurship/innovation-related offerings
    - Wharton because of healthcare offerings, but I'm not a fan of their cutthroat culture or location
