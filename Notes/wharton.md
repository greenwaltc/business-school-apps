# Wharton essay #1 notes

## Healthcare/medical technology companies that hired out of Whart for the class of 2022:

    - Humana
    - Pfizer
    - Redesign Health

## Experiences from past that tie into future path

    - Developing CEP, a platform to push marketing messages
    - Leading CEP for a time, including all the responsibilities that demanded and the perspective I got on product development
    - Streamlining regulatory document creation and managment. The lean here is that I've got insight into the regulatory hurdles that slow down corporate innovation and increase the difficulty in getting new treatment therapies to patients.

### Something Global

Definitely want to talk about the SF campus 2nd Fall semester for this one

### Leadership Development / Experiential Learning

Maybe something entrepreneurship related

Venture lab -> mention design studios?. Basically the idea with mentioning this is that I'll get access and experience into the world of entrepreneurship (hands-on) in a way that I can't do on my own. I would be surrounded by ambitious, like-minded individuals who want to tackle big problems. The experiences I will have here will shape how I start a business later in my career. (How?)

### Professional focused club

If it's a club in an industry that I currently work in, then I can move this to the second essay and talk about my contribution. Contribution would be the unique perspective I have as a software engineer in the medtech industry--medical companies don't know how to be software companies.
