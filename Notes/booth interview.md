Other schools: 

- Duke
    - Healthcare in NC but no support for medical devices
    - Booth has just as much team support as does Duke with their "Team Fuqua"
    - Duke doesn't have a Polsky center
    - Booth has more flexible curriculum (least number of required courses of any top B-school)

- Wharton
    - Has the HCM major (like Booth)
    - Has Tangen Hall but there's fewer "deep tech" stuff going on at Tangen Hall than Polsky Center
    - I'm not as good a cultural fit for Wharton as I am for Booth, given my interactions with Booth students.
    - Booth has more flexible curriculum
