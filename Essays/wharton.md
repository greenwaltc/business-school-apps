When I was 18, I sat in the lobby of a psychiatry clinic. I watched as the local fire department entered the building, walked through the lobby to one of the back rooms, and escorted my dad out of the building to involuntarily commit him to a psychiatric facility for in-patient care. Many years prior to this incident, my dad had suffered a series of mini-strokes that had destroyed several key areas of functionality in his brain, leading to him developing symptoms resembling borderline personality disorder. His behavior drove my mom to obtain a permanent restraining order against him and pursue divorce.
Though my upbringing was challenging, I knew that I wanted my life to be different. More importantly, I knew that I wanted to reduce the amount of medical suffering in other's lives.
